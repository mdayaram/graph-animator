Graph Animator
==============

Tablet application to run simulations of different graph algorithms.

This is a project I worked on the the spring semester of my sophomore year in college as an independent study on tablet applications and pedagogy under the advisement of professor [Ananda Gunawardena](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guna/).

It was actually kind of funny.  I spent the first half of the semester meeting with him and we would literary spend the entire meeting asking eachother:

> Guna: So what would you like to do?  
> Me: I don't know, what would you like me to do?  
> Guna: Well, how about something related to tablets and pedagogy?  
> Me: Sounds great! Let me get back to you with some ideas.  

Finally, the week before spring break I came up with a tablet application for simulating Dijkstra's Algorithm which is what we were learning in class at the time.  He gave me the OK to go at it, I wrote a [proposal](docs/proposal.md), and spent pretty much all of spring break working on it.

Come the end of the year, I wrote up a [final report](docs/finalreport.md) and submitted my last version.  Unfortunately, when I first wrote up the code for Graph Animator I didn't really know how to use source control, but I kept each incremental version on a zip file.

Throughout the years, I lost some information, but I tried to transfer as much as I could into [github](https://github.com/mdayaram/graph-animator/).  I [tagged](https://github.com/mdayaram/graph-animator/tags) each 'release' that I made, and each tag contains a built executable inside the [bin/Debug](https://github.com/mdayaram/graph-animator/blob/master/bin/Debug/GraphAnimator.exe) directory.  So feel free to poke around and try to install it if you'd like to play with it.  Hopefully it still works!
