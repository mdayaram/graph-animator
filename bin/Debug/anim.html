<h2>Playing the Animation</h2>

Not much info here yet.  Just draw a graph, make sure you have a destination and home node picked out, pick an animation from the drop down box, and click play.  
<br><br>
Step back doesn't work as of yet.
<br><br>
Step forward, pause, stop, and play work just fine.
